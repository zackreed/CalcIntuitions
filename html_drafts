                <p>This is a <strong>group discussion.</strong></p>
                <p>Over the course of MATH 241 and MATH 242, we developed an appreciation for the primary way to understand and utilize the definite integral, that of "Adding Up Pieces." Definite integration allows us to functionally extend multiplication to cases where basic multiplication does not apply. We examined many basic contexts such as motion, area, volume, gravitational attraction, energy, kinetic energy, population distribution, and fluid forces, all of which began with a basic physical model, which we then extended to handle some complexity.</p>
                <p>In the case of work, if we have a uniform force applied segment of distance, then we can express the work done as <img class="equation_image" title="W=F\cdot D" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/W%253DF%255Ccdot%2520D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: W=F\cdot D" data-equation-content="W=F\cdot D" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. In the case of compressing a spring inward, the force increases with distance, with linear force functions such as <img class="equation_image" title="F(D)=55\cdot D" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/F(D)%253D55%255Ccdot%2520D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: F(D)=55\cdot D" data-equation-content="F(D)=55\cdot D" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> Newtons. There is no one force to use over any interval of distance to compute work. Instead, we approximated the work done over small intervals of time spanning <img class="equation_image" title="dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dD" data-equation-content="dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> meters, and let a distance within that small interval give the representative force so that the small work change could be represented by <img class="equation_image" title="dW=F(D)\cdot dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dW%253DF(D)%255Ccdot%2520dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dW=F(D)\cdot dD" data-equation-content="dW=F(D)\cdot dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. We then summed together the small work changes <img class="equation_image" title="dW" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dW?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dW" data-equation-content="dW" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> to give the total work change <img class="equation_image" title="\int dW=\int F(D)\cdot dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Cint%2520dW%253D%255Cint%2520F(D)%255Ccdot%2520dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \int dW=\int F(D)\cdot dD" data-equation-content="\int dW=\int F(D)\cdot dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This notion of "adding up pieces" is made rigorous by taking limits of Riemann Sums.</p>
                <p>The following GeoGebra application demonstrates this notion of "adding up pieces" in the context of spring compression. You may alter the "Stopping Distance X=" slider to change the distance to which the spring is compressed inward from rest. You may alter the "View Differential Change Elements" slider to visualize the small bit of energy computed over varying small bits of distance <img class="equation_image" title="dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dD" data-equation-content="dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.&nbsp;</p>

Notice that the force <img class="equation_image" title="F(D)" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/F(D)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: F(D)" data-equation-content="F(D)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> grows as the spring is pressed further inward, hence the increasing size of the differential change <img class="equation_image" title="dE" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dE?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dE" data-equation-content="dE" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />relative to the fixed distance interval <img class="equation_image" title="dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dD" data-equation-content="dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. This visualizes the summation process represented by <img class="equation_image" title="\int dE=\int_0^X F(D)\cdot dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Cint%2520dE%253D%255Cint_0%255EX%2520F(D)%255Ccdot%2520dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \int dE=\int_0^X F(D)\cdot dD" data-equation-content="\int dE=\int_0^X F(D)\cdot dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.</p>
                <p>In more complex scenarios, the process of building small pieces of a quantity to be summed together remained the same! There is always only one way to think about integration, and this same way of thinking will apply in the following discussion. As a more complex scenario, recall the context of gravitational attraction. Two points having masses <img class="equation_image" title="m_1" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/m_1?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: m_1" data-equation-content="m_1" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> and <img class="equation_image" title="m_2" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/m_2?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: m_2" data-equation-content="m_2" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> separated by a distance <img class="equation_image" title="r" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/r?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: r" data-equation-content="r" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> have a gravitational attraction of <img class="equation_image" title="F=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/F%253D%255Cfrac%257BGm_1m_2%257D%257Br%255E2%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: F=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}" data-equation-content="F=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> (G is a constant term). If we wanted to extend this to finding the gravitational attraction between a point mass and a uniformly dense rod with mass <img class="equation_image" title="M" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/M?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: M" data-equation-content="M" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> and length <img class="equation_image" title="\ell" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Cell?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \ell" data-equation-content="\ell" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> that extends in a line away from the point mass, we can no longer use the basic model <img class="equation_image" title="F=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/F%253D%255Cfrac%257BGm_1m_2%257D%257Br%255E2%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: F=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}" data-equation-content="F=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> because no one distance <img class="equation_image" title="r" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/r?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: r" data-equation-content="r" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> separates the point mass from the rod.</p>
                <p>Instead, we consider a small segment of the rod with length <img class="equation_image" title="dr" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dr?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dr" data-equation-content="dr" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> meters (just like we considered a small time segment with motion) and reconstruct the small gravitational force over that small bit of the rod. If <img class="equation_image" title="m_1" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/m_1?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: m_1" data-equation-content="m_1" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is the point's mass and <img class="equation_image" title="r" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/r?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: r" data-equation-content="r" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is one of a representative distance between the point mass and somewhere along the rod within the segment of length <img class="equation_image" title="dr" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dr?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dr" data-equation-content="dr" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, then we have <img class="equation_image" title="dF=\frac{Gm_1dM}{r^2}" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dF%253D%255Cfrac%257BGm_1dM%257D%257Br%255E2%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dF=\frac{Gm_1dM}{r^2}" data-equation-content="dF=\frac{Gm_1dM}{r^2}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, where <img class="equation_image" title="dM" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dM?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dM" data-equation-content="dM" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is the mass of the small segment that we chose.</p>
                <p>This segmentation is depicted in the following GeoGebra application, where you can increase or decrease N to view large or small rod segments, and may alter "Sample Distance=" to see an approximation of <img class="equation_image" title="dF=\frac{Gm_1dM}{r^2}" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dF%253D%255Cfrac%257BGm_1dM%257D%257Br%255E2%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dF=\frac{Gm_1dM}{r^2}" data-equation-content="dF=\frac{Gm_1dM}{r^2}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> over any small segment of the rod.</p>

                <p>Since the rod is uniformly dense, the density of the rod <img class="equation_image" title="\frac{M}{\ell}" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Cfrac%257BM%257D%257B%255Cell%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \frac{M}{\ell}" data-equation-content="\frac{M}{\ell}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> lets us determine the mass of the small segment by considering the segment length <img class="equation_image" title="dr" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dr?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dr" data-equation-content="dr" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. This gives us <img class="equation_image" title="dF=\frac{Gm_1dM}{r^2}=\frac{Gm_1\frac{M}{\ell}dr}{r^2}" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dF%253D%255Cfrac%257BGm_1dM%257D%257Br%255E2%257D%253D%255Cfrac%257BGm_1%255Cfrac%257BM%257D%257B%255Cell%257Ddr%257D%257Br%255E2%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dF=\frac{Gm_1dM}{r^2}=\frac{Gm_1\frac{M}{\ell}dr}{r^2}" data-equation-content="dF=\frac{Gm_1dM}{r^2}=\frac{Gm_1\frac{M}{\ell}dr}{r^2}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, and we can sum the small force pieces along the length of the rod to get <img class="equation_image" title="\int dF=\int\frac{Gm_1\frac{M}{\ell}dr}{r^2}" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Cint%2520dF%253D%255Cint%255Cfrac%257BGm_1%255Cfrac%257BM%257D%257B%255Cell%257Ddr%257D%257Br%255E2%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \int dF=\int\frac{Gm_1\frac{M}{\ell}dr}{r^2}" data-equation-content="\int dF=\int\frac{Gm_1\frac{M}{\ell}dr}{r^2}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. Again, the details for this example are a bit more involved, but the details are rooted in attention to what the integral represents, a process of summing together small bits of a quantity (distance, force, etc.) by attending to how you construct the quantity over small regions.</p>

                <p>Double and Triple integrals are no different. We merely have more tools for constructing the basic quantities over more complicated objects. Often, constructing double and triple integrals depends on working with a small volume element <img class="equation_image" title="dV" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dV?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dV" data-equation-content="dV" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.

                <p>As a warm-up, you first want to find the mass of your chosen shape.

The basic model for gravitational attraction between two uniformly dense point masses is given by Newton's Law of Gravitation: <img class="equation_image" title="F=\frac{G\cdot m_1\cdot m_2}{D^2}" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/F%253D%255Cfrac%257BG%255Ccdot%2520m_1%255Ccdot%2520m_2%257D%257BD%255E2%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: F=\frac{G\cdot m_1\cdot m_2}{D^2}" data-equation-content="F=\frac{G\cdot m_1\cdot m_2}{D^2}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, where <img class="equation_image" title="G\approx 6.6743\times 10^{-11}" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/G%255Capprox%25206.6743%255Ctimes%252010%255E%257B-11%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: G\approx 6.6743\times 10^{-11}" data-equation-content="G\approx 6.6743\times 10^{-11}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, <img class="equation_image" title="m_1" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/m_1?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: m_1" data-equation-content="m_1" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /><em>&nbsp;</em>and <img class="equation_image" title="m_2" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/m_2?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: m_2" data-equation-content="m_2" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />&nbsp;are the point masses, and <em><img class="equation_image" title="3 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/3%2520%255Cfrac%257B%255Ctext%257Bkg%257D%257D%257B%255Ctext%257Bm%257D%255E3%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: 3 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}" data-equation-content="3 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> </em>is the distance between the points.<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>For your problem, the point has mass <img class="equation_image" title="m=\frac{M}{10}" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/m%253D%255Cfrac%257BM%257D%257B10%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: m=\frac{M}{10}" data-equation-content="m=\frac{M}{10}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, where <img class="equation_image" title="M" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/M?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: M" data-equation-content="M" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is the mass of your chosen object. For <em>Shape 1</em>, the point is 10 meters directly below the tip of the cone, and the cone is now <em>uniformly dense </em>(meaning that no one volume region is more dense than another). For <em>Shape 2</em>, the point is located 15 meters from the center of the sphere. (Note: Technically, with symmetric cases such as these, there is a cancellation of the horizontal gravitational forces; we will ignore this fact for ease of computation).</p>
                <p><strong>Task Two:</strong></p>
                <p>During Module 1, you examined the work done by our backs when we lift a box (using both improper and proper techniques). Because of our available tools at the time, we could only approximate the work done by our backs when improperly lifting a box. With the advent of line integrals within a vector field, we now have the ability to exactly compute the work done by our backs from this motion.&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="" style="border-style: solid; border-color: #0a3665; padding: 5px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Task:</strong></span> Your overall goal is to calculate the work done by the lifter's back when she lifts a box under the "Improper Technique."</p>
                <p>First, define the vector fields that capture the weights of our upper bodies and of the box that are involved in the lifting of the box. Use these vector fields to calculate the work done by simply the motion of moving the box and moving the lifter's upper body along the paths.

                <p>The MATH 240 series is primarily designed to prepare students for engineering courses. In collaboration with the engineering programs at ERAU, we are gently and progressively incorporating MATLAB into the series. In addition to equipping you all with some basic computational skills that you will need to apply very quickly in your engineering courses, we also have the goal of enabling you to focus on the significant ideas of the calculus curriculum by strategically offloading your by-hand computational workload.</p>
                <p>In general, your abilities to interpret and analyze the results of calculus-based computations will be equally as important as your abilities to make said computations. In these discussions, think of MATLAB more as a useful tool to be used strategically as part of your problem-solving process than as the primary vehicle for your work.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>A <strong>substantial portion of your grade</strong> in this discussion revolves around your <strong>participation</strong>. Expect to not only post your solutions to these prompts but also to reply to your peers' prompts and to <strong>work together&nbsp;towards a solution</strong>. Also, this discussion is more about progress throughout the course of Modules 4 and 5 than it is about perfection on an early attempt. Do not go to tutors for help on these, especially early on. Instead, post your attempts even if you don't have the best answer. Write in your posts about what confuses you so that your peers and instructor can help, and then throughout the course of the activity, you will together move towards a solution rather than individually. You must share your initial post before you can see others' replies.</p>
                <p>Throughout, you should refer to the <a title="STEM Discourse" href="https://erau.instructure.com/courses/189336/pages/stem-discourse" data-api-endpoint="https://erau.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/189336/pages/stem-discourse" data-api-returntype="Page">STEM Discourse page</a> to make sure your posts are making meaningful contributions to the discussion.</p>
                <p>Make the following posts.</p>
                <p>1. By the third day of Module 7, make an initial <strong>brainstorming&nbsp;</strong>post for your assigned <strong>Task One Shape</strong>. This post must be made before you see other students' work and before you actually attempt the problem.&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 40px;">A. <strong>Brainstorm Post Requirements</strong>: After reading the problem, but before making any calculations, you must write out in words your best conjecture of a solution trajectory for the problem. Your solution trajectory must generally describe how you think the problem should be solved, including what calculations you anticipate needing to make and ideas for how to use the results of those calculations to progress toward a solution. You must also include a labeled drawing or diagram of the problem, referencing the quantities that you anticipate being useful in your solution.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 40px;">B. The point of this post is to be a brainstorm; you're encouraged to give your best guess (even if you end up being way off), to describe what you don't understand about the problem, or even to lay out your current understanding of vectors and then conclude that you're not sure where to start. You will solve the problems <strong>together&nbsp;</strong>by the end of the week, so the point is to work together and help and build from each other.</p>
                <p>2. By the fourth day of Module 7, post an initial solution to your assigned <strong>Task One Shape.</strong> This should build off of your and your peers' brainstorming post, but it is still fine for your initial solution to be incomplete!</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 40px;">A. By this time, you must <strong>meaningfully comment&nbsp;</strong>(i.e., engage in STEM Discourse) on at least two other students' brainstorming posts corresponding to the <strong>other Task One Shape.&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>3. By the end of the last day of Module 7, your group is responsible for posting a polished solution to <strong>Task One</strong>. The solution should not just consist of calculations but must include relevant evidence and a justification of the solution's correctness, as described on the STEM Discourse page. The solution must also include appropriately labeled diagrams of the quantities at play. You will all receive the same grade based on the polished solution, and you will individually receive a grade for your contributions toward determining and/or confirming the solution. It is not enough to contribute by merely agreeing or disagreeing with what your peers say; you must support your assent or dissent with evidence and justification.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>4. By the third day of Module 8, make an initial <strong>brainstorming&nbsp;</strong>post for <strong>Task Two</strong>.</p>
                <p>5. By the fourth day of Module 8, post an initial solution to <strong>Task Two.</strong> This should build off of your and your peers' brainstorming post, but it is still fine for your initial solution to be incomplete!</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 40px;">A. By this time, you must <strong>meaningfully comment&nbsp;</strong>(i.e., engage in STEM Discourse) on at least two other students' brainstorming posts, either incorporating their ideas with your own or providing <em>constructive</em> critique and offering ideas for moving forward from their brainstorm. You must also reference two other students' brainstorming posts as being influential in your initial solution.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>6. By the end of the last day of Module 8, your group is responsible for posting a polished solution to <strong>Task Two</strong>. The solution should not just consist of calculations but must include relevant evidence and a justification of the solution's correctness, as described on the STEM Discourse page. The solution must also include appropriately labeled diagrams of the quantities at play. You will all receive the same grade based on the polished solution, and you will individually receive a grade for your contributions toward determining and/or confirming the solution.
