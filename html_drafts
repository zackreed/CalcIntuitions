                <p>We will spend a large portion of the course discussing multivariable functions, functions that have multiple variable inputs, and (for now) single-variable outputs. We will eventually discuss both derivatives and integrals of these functions, but currently, we introduce the basic constructions of functions with two or three variables.</p>
                <p>The volume of a right circular cylinder is a function <img class="equation_image" title="V=\pi r^2h" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/V%253D%255Cpi%2520r%255E2h?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: V=\pi r^2h" data-equation-content="V=\pi r^2h" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> of its radius and its height, so it is a function <img class="equation_image" title="V(r,h)" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/V(r%252Ch)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: V(r,h)" data-equation-content="V(r,h)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> of two variables <img class="equation_image" title="r" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/r?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: r" data-equation-content="r" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> and <img class="equation_image" title="h" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/h?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: h" data-equation-content="h" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. The speed of sound through seawater is primarily a function of salinity <img class="equation_image" title="S" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/S?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: S" data-equation-content="S" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> and temperature <img class="equation_image" title="T" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/T?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: T" data-equation-content="T" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. The monthly payment on a home mortgage is a function of the principal borrowed <img class="equation_image" title="P" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/P?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: P" data-equation-content="P" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, the interest rate <img class="equation_image" title="i" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/i?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: i" data-equation-content="i" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, and the term <img class="equation_image" title="t" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/t?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: t" data-equation-content="t" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> of the loan. These are examples of functions that depend on more than one independent variable.</p>

                <p>We will extend the idea of single-variable differential calculus to functions of several variables. Their derivatives are more varied and interesting because of the different ways the variables can interact. The applications of these derivatives are also more varied than for single-variable calculus, and in later modules, we will see that the same is true for integrals involving several variables.</p>
                <p>Real-valued functions of several independent real variables are defined analogously to functions of a single variable. Points in the domain are now ordered pairs (triples, quadruples, <img class="equation_image" title="n" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/n?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: n" data-equation-content="n" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />-tuples) of real numbers, and values in the range are real numbers.</p>
