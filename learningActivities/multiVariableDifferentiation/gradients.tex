\section*{Introduction: Local Linearity Revisited}

One of the central ideas from Calculus I was \textbf{local linearity}. For a function $f(x)$, if its derivative $f'(a)$ exists, then we can treat $f$ \textit{as if it were a line} with slope $f'(a)$ if we don't move too far from the point $(a, f(a))$.

\begin{problem}
Let's review local linearity from single-variable calculus.

\begin{expandable}{stuff}{GeoGebra Instructions}
    Alter the ``a='' slider to view the local linearity of $f$ at different points. Check or uncheck the ``Show Local Linearity'' and ``Show Tangent Line'' boxes to control what you view.

After exploring, answer: What does the tangent line represent?
\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{The exact function $f(x)$}
    \choice[correct]{A linear approximation of $f(x)$ near the point of tangency}
    \choice{The derivative $f'(x)$}
    \choice{The area under the curve}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{feedback}
The tangent line gives us a simple linear approximation: $f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$ near $x=a$.
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\section*{Extending to Multiple Variables}

Now with multivariable functions, we need to account for variation in at least two variables simultaneously. We have two complementary approaches:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Reduce complexity}: Look at slices along lines (directional derivatives)
    \item \textbf{Full extension}: Create tangent planes (using all partial derivatives together)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Approach 1: Slicing Along Lines}

Rather than dealing with complexity of multiple variables for $f(x,y)$, we can consider how $f$ changes along a single line—which behaves like the $x$-axis in single-variable calculus.

\begin{problem}
Explore directional derivatives by slicing the surface.

\begin{expandable}{stuff}{GeoGebra Instructions}
    Drag the point $(x,y)$ on the right screen to shift the input point (you may need to hide the surface).
    
    Drag the green point at the end of the $\vec{u}$ vector to change the direction of the line.
    
    Select ``Zoom to Differential'' to see the tangent line along that direction.
\end{expandable}

\begin{center}
\geogebra{y3bnsnbv}{740}{612}
\end{center}

The differentials $ds$ and $df$ have the same interpretation along the chosen line as $dx$ and $df$ did in single-variable calculus!

When you rotate $\vec{u}$ to be horizontal or vertical, you get:
\begin{selectAll}
    \choice[correct]{Partial derivatives with respect to $x$ or $y$}
    \choice{The full gradient}
    \choice[correct]{Rates of change while holding one variable constant}
    \choice{The tangent plane}
\end{selectAll}

\begin{feedback}
Horizontal direction gives $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ (holding $y$ constant), vertical gives $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ (holding $x$ constant).
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\section*{Partial Derivatives}

\begin{definition}
The \textbf{partial derivative} of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ at $(a,b)$ is:
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a,b) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h,b) - f(a,b)}{h}$$

This measures the rate of change in the $x$-direction while holding $y$ constant.

Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to $y$ is:
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a,b) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a,b+h) - f(a,b)}{h}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}
Let's compute some partial derivatives. For $f(x,y) = x^2y + 3y^2$:

The partial derivative with respect to $x$ is:
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \answer{2xy}$$

The partial derivative with respect to $y$ is:
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \answer{x^2 + 6y}$$

At the point $(2,1)$:
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(2,1) = \answer{4}$$
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(2,1) = \answer{10}$$

\begin{feedback}
When computing $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$, treat $y$ as a constant. When computing $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$, treat $x$ as a constant. It's like single-variable calculus, but focusing on one variable at a time!
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Compute partial derivatives for $g(x,y) = e^{xy} + \sin(x) + y^3$:

$$\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = \answer{ye^{xy} + \cos(x)}$$

$$\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = \answer{xe^{xy} + 3y^2}$$

\begin{feedback}
For $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}$: treat $y$ as constant, so $e^{xy}$ differentiates using chain rule to give $ye^{xy}$.
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\subsection*{Approach 2: Tangent Planes}

The truest extension of tangent lines is the \textbf{tangent plane}—a plane that approximates the function near a point, using linear variation in each direction.

\begin{problem}
Visualize the tangent plane.

\begin{expandable}{stuff}{GeoGebra Instructions}
    Drag the point $(x,y)$ on the right screen to alter the location of the tangency point (you may need to hide the surface).
\end{expandable}

\begin{center}
\geogebra{pkdrny3n}{741}{581}
\end{center}

Notice the similarity to single-variable local linearity! The tangent plane approximates $f(x,y)$ when we don't move too far from $(a,b,f(a,b))$.

The tangent plane is defined by:
\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{Only $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$}
    \choice{Only $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$}
    \choice[correct]{Both $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ together}
    \choice{The gradient magnitude}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{feedback}
Both partial derivatives are needed because we have two dimensions of variation in the input!
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\section*{The Total Differential and Tangent Planes}

In single-variable calculus, vertical motion was determined by $df = f'(a) \cdot dx$.

For multivariable functions, we have the \textbf{total differential}:
$$dz = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a,b) \cdot dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a,b) \cdot dy$$

This determines motion along the tangent plane away from $(a,b,f(a,b))$.

\begin{problem}
For $f(x,y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$ at the point $(1,2)$:

First compute partial derivatives:
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \answer{2x + 2y}$$
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \answer{2x + 2y}$$

At $(1,2)$:
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(1,2) = \answer{6}$$
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(1,2) = \answer{6}$$

The total differential at $(1,2)$ is:
$$dz = \answer{6} \cdot dx + \answer{6} \cdot dy$$

If we move $dx = 0.1$ and $dy = 0.05$, the approximate change in $f$ is:
$$dz \approx 6(0.1) + 6(0.05) = \answer{0.9}$$

\begin{feedback}
The tangent plane provides a linear approximation: $f(x,y) \approx f(a,b) + f_x(a,b)(x-a) + f_y(a,b)(y-b)$.
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\section*{Directional Derivatives}

What if we want the rate of change in a direction other than purely $x$ or $y$?

\begin{definition}
The \textbf{directional derivative} of $f$ at $(a,b)$ in the direction of unit vector $\vec{u} = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle$ is:
$$D_{\vec{u}}f(a,b) = \frac{df}{ds} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a,b) \cdot u_1 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a,b) \cdot u_2$$

where $s$ is arc length along the direction $\vec{u}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}
Explore directional derivatives interactively.

\begin{expandable}{stuff}{GeoGebra Instructions}
    Drag the tip of $\vec{u}$ on the right screen to change direction. Check ``Show Directional Derivative'' to visualize $dz$ and $ds$.
\end{expandable}

\begin{center}
\geogebra{y3bnsnbv}{740}{612}
\end{center}

Check ``Show Differential Build'' to see how $ds$ breaks down into $dx$ and $dy$ components!

The directional derivative depends on:
\begin{selectAll}
    \choice[correct]{The direction vector $\vec{u}$}
    \choice[correct]{Both partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$}
    \choice{Only the partial derivative in the chosen direction}
    \choice[correct]{The dot product structure}
\end{selectAll}

\begin{feedback}
Since $\vec{u} = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle$ runs along a line, its derivatives $\frac{dx}{ds} = u_1$ and $\frac{dy}{ds} = u_2$ are simply its components!
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Let's compute a directional derivative. For $f(x,y) = x^2 - xy + y^2$ at $(2,1)$ in the direction of $\vec{v} = \langle 3, 4 \rangle$:

First, normalize $\vec{v}$ to get the unit vector:
$$|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \answer{5}$$
$$\vec{u} = \frac{1}{5}\langle 3, 4 \rangle = \langle \answer{0.6}, \answer{0.8} \rangle$$

Compute partial derivatives:
$$f_x = \answer{2x - y}$$
$$f_y = \answer{-x + 2y}$$

At $(2,1)$:
$$f_x(2,1) = \answer{3}$$
$$f_y(2,1) = \answer{0}$$

The directional derivative is:
$$D_{\vec{u}}f(2,1) = 3(0.6) + 0(0.8) = \answer{1.8}$$

\begin{feedback}
This means if we move from $(2,1)$ in the direction $\langle 0.6, 0.8 \rangle$, the function increases at a rate of $1.8$ per unit distance.
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\section*{The Gradient Vector}

Notice that the directional derivative formula:
$$D_{\vec{u}}f = f_x \cdot u_1 + f_y \cdot u_2$$

is actually a dot product!

\begin{definition}
The \textbf{gradient} of $f$ at $(a,b)$ is the vector:
$$\nabla f(a,b) = \left\langle \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a,b), \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a,b) \right\rangle$$

The directional derivative is then:
$$D_{\vec{u}}f = \nabla f \cdot \vec{u}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}
Explore the gradient vector interactively!

\begin{expandable}{stuff}{GeoGebra Instructions}
    Check the ``Show Gradient'' box and uncheck others to remove clutter. Drag $\vec{u}$ around to see how the directional derivative changes.
\end{expandable}

\begin{center}
\geogebra{y3bnsnbv}{740}{612}
\end{center}

Observe: When is the directional derivative largest?
\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{When $\vec{u}$ is perpendicular to $\nabla f$}
    \choice[correct]{When $\vec{u}$ points in the same direction as $\nabla f$}
    \choice{When $\vec{u}$ points opposite to $\nabla f$}
    \choice{It's always the same regardless of direction}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{feedback}
Since $D_{\vec{u}}f = \nabla f \cdot \vec{u} = |\nabla f||\vec{u}|\cos\theta$ and $|\vec{u}| = 1$, the maximum occurs when $\cos\theta = 1$, i.e., when $\vec{u}$ and $\nabla f$ are aligned!
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\subsection*{Key Property of the Gradient}

\begin{problem}
The gradient has a special geometric meaning:

\begin{selectAll}
    \choice[correct]{$\nabla f$ points in the direction of steepest increase}
    \choice[correct]{$|\nabla f|$ gives the maximum rate of increase}
    \choice[correct]{$-\nabla f$ points in the direction of steepest decrease}
    \choice{$\nabla f$ is always perpendicular to the surface}
    \choice[correct]{When $\vec{u} \perp \nabla f$, the directional derivative is zero}
\end{selectAll}

\begin{feedback}
When $\vec{u} \perp \nabla f$, we have $\nabla f \cdot \vec{u} = 0$, meaning no change in that direction—this defines a level curve!
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Compute gradients for the following functions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For $f(x,y) = 3x^2 + 4y^2$:
    
    $$\nabla f = \langle \answer{6x}, \answer{8y} \rangle$$
    
    At $(1,2)$: $\nabla f(1,2) = \langle \answer{6}, \answer{16} \rangle$
    
    \item For $g(x,y) = xe^y + \sin(xy)$:
    
    $$\nabla g = \langle \answer{e^y + y\cos(xy)}, \answer{xe^y + x\cos(xy)} \rangle$$
    
    \item For $h(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$:
    
    $$\nabla h = \langle \answer{2x}, \answer{2y}, \answer{2z} \rangle$$
    
    This gradient points \wordChoice{\choice{toward the origin}\choice[correct]{away from the origin}\choice{tangent to the sphere}}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{feedback}
For a sphere $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2$, the gradient at any point is the position vector, pointing radially outward—perpendicular to the sphere!
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\section*{Applications of the Gradient}

\subsection*{Finding Level Curves}

\begin{problem}
Level curves are paths along which $f$ is constant. Since $\nabla f \cdot \vec{u} = 0$ when moving along a level curve:

The gradient is \wordChoice{\choice{tangent to}\choice[correct]{perpendicular to}\choice{parallel to}} level curves.

For $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$, the level curves are circles centered at the origin. The gradient $\nabla f = \langle 2x, 2y \rangle$ points:
\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{Tangent to the circles}
    \choice[correct]{Radially outward from the origin}
    \choice{Toward the origin}
    \choice{Tangent to the surface}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{feedback}
The gradient always points perpendicular to level curves, in the direction of greatest increase!
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\subsection*{Optimization Preview}

\begin{problem}
At a local maximum or minimum of $f(x,y)$, what must be true about $\nabla f$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$\nabla f$ points upward}
    \choice{$\nabla f$ points downward}
    \choice[correct]{$\nabla f = \langle 0, 0 \rangle$ (gradient is zero)}
    \choice{$\nabla f$ has maximum magnitude}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{feedback}
At extrema, there's no direction of increase or decrease, so the gradient must be zero. This is the multivariable version of setting $f'(x) = 0$!
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\section*{Summary and Synthesis}

\begin{problem}
Let's bring it all together. For $f(x,y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^2$ at the point $(1,1)$:

\textbf{Step 1: Partial Derivatives}
$$f_x = \answer{2x - 2y}$$
$$f_y = \answer{-2x + 2y}$$

At $(1,1)$: $f_x(1,1) = \answer{0}$ and $f_y(1,1) = \answer{0}$

\textbf{Step 2: Gradient}
$$\nabla f(1,1) = \langle \answer{0}, \answer{0} \rangle$$

\textbf{Step 3: Interpretation}
Since $\nabla f(1,1) = \vec{0}$, the point $(1,1)$ is a:
\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{Local maximum}
    \choice{Local minimum}
    \choice[correct]{Critical point (could be max, min, or saddle)}
    \choice{Not a critical point}
\end{multipleChoice}

\textbf{Step 4: Directional Derivatives}
The directional derivative in any direction at $(1,1)$ is:
$$D_{\vec{u}}f(1,1) = \nabla f(1,1) \cdot \vec{u} = \answer{0}$$

\begin{feedback}
When the gradient is zero, all directional derivatives are zero—the function is "flat" in all directions at that point. We'll need second derivatives (the Hessian) to classify it further!
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Final check: Select all TRUE statements about gradients.

\begin{selectAll}
    \choice[correct]{The gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent}
    \choice[correct]{The gradient magnitude is the maximum rate of increase}
    \choice[correct]{The gradient is perpendicular to level curves}
    \choice{The gradient always has magnitude 1}
    \choice[correct]{Directional derivatives are computed using the dot product with the gradient}
    \choice[correct]{When $\nabla f = \vec{0}$, we have a critical point}
    \choice{The gradient points upward on the surface}
    \choice[correct]{$D_{\vec{u}}f = \nabla f \cdot \vec{u}$ for unit vector $\vec{u}$}
\end{selectAll}

\begin{feedback}
Excellent! You've mastered the gradient—one of the most important concepts in multivariable calculus. The gradient connects partial derivatives, directional derivatives, optimization, and level curves in a beautiful unified framework!
\end{feedback}
\end{problem}
