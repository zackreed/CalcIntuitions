\title{Final Project Help: Classification with Gradient Descent}
\author{Zack Reed}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
This page will help you as you work on your final project, exploring how to model classification problems using gradient descent. We'll begin with a simple linear classifier, then extend it to more complex models using calculus and optimization techniques.

\section*{Introduction}

Welcome to the introduction to the ``gravity between a wire and a point'' mini project!  
As with all integration problems, we'll begin with a simple situation where multiplication suffices, and then build up toward an integral model that accounts for continuous variation.
