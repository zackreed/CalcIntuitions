\begin{abstract}
In this project you'll explore how to model the work required to overcome drag forces when an object moves along a curve. We'll start with a simple ``ideal'' situation that can be modeled using multiplication, and then build up to an integration-based approach that adds up contributions across the motion.

\section*{Introduction}

Welcome to the introduction to the ``Work Done Against Drag'' mini project!  
As with all integration problems, we will begin with a simple situation where multiplication suffices, and then build up toward an integral model that accounts for continuous variation.
