\section*{Introduction}

Welcome to your first project walkthrough!
This walkthrough will give you a good glimpse of some of the main ways we want to think about differentiating and integrating along curves when modeling phenomena using mathematics! 

This will also give you a rough template and introduce you to the tools that you can use for your mini project, due at the end of this module.
