This page will help you as you work on your final project, exploring how to model the gravitational attraction between a solid and a point mass. We'll begin with the idealized point-mass formula, then extend it to piecewise and continuous approximations using calculus.

\section*{Introduction}

Welcome to the introduction to the ``gravity between a wire and a point'' mini project!  
As with all integration problems, we'll begin with a simple situation where multiplication suffices, and then build up toward an integral model that accounts for continuous variation.
