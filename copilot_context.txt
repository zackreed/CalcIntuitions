        <p>One way to conceive of this course is as the progressive adaptation of single-variable mathematical operations and tools into the more complicated multivariable setting. We spent Modules 3-5 exploring various ways to extend the notion of local linearity and derivatives from single to multivariable settings. This included defining the tangent vector on curves, partial and directional derivatives, gradients, and tangent planes. Each of these concepts adapted the notion of derivative into multiple dimensions by attending to different ways that we must account for variation in multivariable curves and functions. Now, we will do the same with definite integrals.</p>
        <p>Definite integration in a single-variable setting amounted to breaking down an object or a process into small pieces, making a measurement across each of those small pieces, and summing the result of those small measurements together. In the single-variable setting, this process was always carried out across a number line so that the small segments were always in some interval.</p>
        <p>In the following example, for instance, calculating the energy required to compress a spring from rest required attention to small intervals of distance <img class="equation_image" title="dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dD" data-equation-content="dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, where the energy required to press the spring inward over that small distance was approximately the product <img class="equation_image" title="F(D)\cdot dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/F(D)%255Ccdot%2520dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: F(D)\cdot dD" data-equation-content="F(D)\cdot dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, the force-distance product over that interval. You can alter the number of intervals displayed, the total distance over which you compress the spring, and then the specific interval being approximated at any one time.</p>
        <p><iframe style="border: 0px;" title="Module 8 FTC Interactive" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/hvs3vqzz/width/670/height/477/border/888888/sfsb/true/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ai/false/asb/false/sri/false/rc/false/ld/false/sdz/false/ctl/false" width="670px" height="477px" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
        <p>The integral was constructed by taking the limit of the sums that approximated energy, creating an exact measure of the energy needed to compress the spring inward by the calculation <img class="equation_image" title="\Delta E=\int dE=\int_0^X F(D)\cdot dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255CDelta%2520E%253D%255Cint%2520dE%253D%255Cint_0%255EX%2520F(D)%255Ccdot%2520dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \Delta E=\int dE=\int_0^X F(D)\cdot dD" data-equation-content="\Delta E=\int dE=\int_0^X F(D)\cdot dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. While we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to calculate the value of this integral, its meaning is still found in the summation of small energy bits by multiplying force across some small interval of distance, as can be visualized by taking a large number of integrals in the GeoGebra application.</p>
        <p>When we consider multivariable functions, we must now attend to variation in both input variables at once, which entails creating a grid of small squares with area <img class="equation_image" title="dA" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dA?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dA" data-equation-content="dA" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> rather than breaking apart a line into small intervals of length <img class="equation_image" title="dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dD" data-equation-content="dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.</p>
        <p>This is visualized in the following GeoGebra Application, where the region over which the integral is to be calculated is contained within the x-y rectangle on the bottom screen. You can alter the dimensions of the rectangle by dragging the point at the top right corner of the rectangle, or you can alter the size of each rectangle on the grid at one time. You can also visualize a single volume approximation at a specific area <img class="equation_image" title="dA" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dA?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dA" data-equation-content="dA" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> on the grid, or you can visualize the entire volume approximation across the grid.</p>
        <p><iframe style="border: 0px;" title="243 Mod 6 Double Integral Approximation" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/yukegeqk/width/755/height/628/border/888888/sfsb/true/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ai/false/asb/false/sri/false/rc/false/ld/false/sdz/false/ctl/false" width="755px" height="628px" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
        <p>The prisms represent the approximate volume underneath the surface created by <img class="equation_image" title="f(x,y)" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/f(x%252Cy)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(x,y)" data-equation-content="f(x,y)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, which comes from the height-area product <img class="equation_image" title="f(a,b)\cdot dA" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/f(a%252Cb)%255Ccdot%2520dA?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(a,b)\cdot dA" data-equation-content="f(a,b)\cdot dA" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. Just as before, the integral is now constructed by taking the small piece of volume <img class="equation_image" title="dV=f(a,b)\cdot dA" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dV%253Df(a%252Cb)%255Ccdot%2520dA?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dV=f(a,b)\cdot dA" data-equation-content="dV=f(a,b)\cdot dA" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> over each rectangle on the grid and then adding up all of the small volumes to make the sum <img class="equation_image" title="V=\iint dV=\iint f(a,b)\cdot dA" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/V%253D%255Ciint%2520dV%253D%255Ciint%2520f(a%252Cb)%255Ccdot%2520dA?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: V=\iint dV=\iint f(a,b)\cdot dA" data-equation-content="V=\iint dV=\iint f(a,b)\cdot dA" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. We call this the&nbsp;<em>double integral</em>. As with the single-variable integral, the double integral is formally the limit of Riemann Sums. In this module, you will learn various ways to calculate the double integral and gain some initial insight into what we can measure with double integrals.</p>

            <div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_0">
                <p>In this module, we define the double integral of a function of two variables <img class="equation_image" title="f(x,y)" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/f(x%252Cy)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(x,y)" data-equation-content="f(x,y)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> over a region in the plane as the limit of approximating Riemann sums. The primary way of thinking about definite integrals is unchanged. The integral is the sum of small "bits" of a measurement (i.e., area, volume, mass, energy, etc.). We are merely increasing the complexity of how we build the particular measurement being summed. Simple hydrostatic force on a rectangular dam offers us a perfect means of demonstrating this extension.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In the single-variable setting, we explored the measuring of force that liquids exert on dams of varying dimensions. The simplest case, that of the force exerted by water on a rectangular dam, is depicted in the following GeoGebra application. A 12x5 dam is given on the left side of the screen, and the dam has been separated into small area regions over which force is being calculated bit by bit. You may alter the "Specific Piece of Area" slider to view the small area region on a dam at different depths and view the resulting increase in force from that small region on the curve on the right side of the screen.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><iframe style="border: 0px;" title="242 Mod 2 Hydrostatic Force" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/xebf6ft3/width/733/height/594/border/888888/sfsb/true/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ai/false/asb/false/sri/false/rc/false/ld/false/sdz/false/ctl/false" width="733px" height="594px" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
                <p>Pressure increases with depth, which is why the purple force curve bends upward. As we move bit-by-bit along the depth of the dam, the amount of force generated over each subsequent area region is increasing. Importantly, the hydrostatic force over each region is given by the product of the pressure over that region and the area of the region, <img class="equation_image" title="dF=P(A)\cdot dA" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dF%253DP(A)%255Ccdot%2520dA?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dF=P(A)\cdot dA" data-equation-content="dF=P(A)\cdot dA" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. In the single-variable case, we were forced to express the area and pressure in terms of the depth so that we could break apart the depth line into small pieces to sum across. We re-wrote <img class="equation_image" title="dA=5\cdot dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dA%253D5%255Ccdot%2520dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dA=5\cdot dD" data-equation-content="dA=5\cdot dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, which is simple enough because of the constant width. <br />We could then compute the total force from the integral <img class="equation_image" title="F=\int dF=\int P(A)\cdot dA=\int_0^{12}P(D)\cdot5\cdot dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/F%253D%255Cint%2520dF%253D%255Cint%2520P(A)%255Ccdot%2520dA%253D%255Cint_0%255E%257B12%257DP(D)%255Ccdot5%255Ccdot%2520dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: F=\int dF=\int P(A)\cdot dA=\int_0^{12}P(D)\cdot5\cdot dD" data-equation-content="F=\int dF=\int P(A)\cdot dA=\int_0^{12}P(D)\cdot5\cdot dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Now, we're going to do the same exact calculation, but we'll now incorporate the entire area of the dam into our calculation. The goal is to calculate the hydrostatic force on a small bit of area, <img class="equation_image" title="dA" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dA?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dA" data-equation-content="dA" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. If we create a grid along the dam, the area is created by the two variables depth <img class="equation_image" title="D" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: D" data-equation-content="D" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> and width <img class="equation_image" title="w" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/w?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: w" data-equation-content="w" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. Because the dam is rectangular, the small bit of area <img class="equation_image" title="dA" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dA?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dA" data-equation-content="dA" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> at any point <img class="equation_image" title="(D,w)" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/(D%252Cw)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: (D,w)" data-equation-content="(D,w)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is given by the product <img class="equation_image" title="dA=dD\cdot dw" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dA%253DdD%255Ccdot%2520dw?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dA=dD\cdot dw" data-equation-content="dA=dD\cdot dw" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, where <img class="equation_image" title="dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dD" data-equation-content="dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is a small depth change and <img class="equation_image" title="dw" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dw?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dw" data-equation-content="dw" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is a small width change.</p>
                <p>What was nice about our hydrostatic force example was that pressure really only changed with depth, which is still true in this case. In the case of water, for instance, the pressure at a depth <img class="equation_image" title="D" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: D" data-equation-content="D" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is given by <img class="equation_image" title="P(D)=9800\cdot D" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/P(D)%253D9800%255Ccdot%2520D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: P(D)=9800\cdot D" data-equation-content="P(D)=9800\cdot D" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. This is true at any width, so the pressure at any point <img class="equation_image" title="(D,w)" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/(D%252Cw)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: (D,w)" data-equation-content="(D,w)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> on the dam is still <img class="equation_image" title="P(D,w)=9800\cdot D" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/P(D%252Cw)%253D9800%255Ccdot%2520D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: P(D,w)=9800\cdot D" data-equation-content="P(D,w)=9800\cdot D" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, and the resulting small bit of force on a small bit of area is given by <img class="equation_image" title="dF=P(A)\cdot dA=9800\cdot D\cdot dD\cdot dw" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dF%253DP(A)%255Ccdot%2520dA%253D9800%255Ccdot%2520D%255Ccdot%2520dD%255Ccdot%2520dw?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dF=P(A)\cdot dA=9800\cdot D\cdot dD\cdot dw" data-equation-content="dF=P(A)\cdot dA=9800\cdot D\cdot dD\cdot dw" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. In the single-variable case, the integral <img class="equation_image" title="\int_0^{12}P(D)\cdot5\cdot dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Cint_0%255E%257B12%257DP(D)%255Ccdot5%255Ccdot%2520dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \int_0^{12}P(D)\cdot5\cdot dD" data-equation-content="\int_0^{12}P(D)\cdot5\cdot dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> comprised the sum symbol <img class="equation_image" title="\int_0^{12}" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Cint_0%255E%257B12%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \int_0^{12}" data-equation-content="\int_0^{12}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, which identified the region over which the summation was taking place, and then the differential <img class="equation_image" title="P(D)\cdot5\cdot dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/P(D)%255Ccdot5%255Ccdot%2520dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: P(D)\cdot5\cdot dD" data-equation-content="P(D)\cdot5\cdot dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> which represented what was being summed. It is no different in these initial cases of double (and then triple) integrals! Since the depth varies from <img class="equation_image" title="0" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/0?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: 0" data-equation-content="0" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> to <img class="equation_image" title="12" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/12?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: 12" data-equation-content="12" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> and the width varies from <img class="equation_image" title="0" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/0?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: 0" data-equation-content="0" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> to <img class="equation_image" title="5" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/5?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: 5" data-equation-content="5" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, we can write the force integral as <img class="equation_image" title="F=\iint dF=\iint P(A)\cdot dA=\int_0^{12}\int_0^5 9800\cdot D\cdot dw\cdot dD" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/F%253D%255Ciint%2520dF%253D%255Ciint%2520P(A)%255Ccdot%2520dA%253D%255Cint_0%255E%257B12%257D%255Cint_0%255E5%25209800%255Ccdot%2520D%255Ccdot%2520dw%255Ccdot%2520dD?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: F=\iint dF=\iint P(A)\cdot dA=\int_0^{12}\int_0^5 9800\cdot D\cdot dw\cdot dD" data-equation-content="F=\iint dF=\iint P(A)\cdot dA=\int_0^{12}\int_0^5 9800\cdot D\cdot dw\cdot dD" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, which ends up being very easy to compute.</p>

                <p>Double integrals are sometimes easier to evaluate if we change to polar coordinates. One main utility of polar coordinates is the ability to describe curved spaces more easily than is possible in rectangular coordinates. Let's take the region within unit circle as a basic example of this. This region is defined as all points of distance less than or equal to 1 from the origin. In rectangular coordinates, this is described as all points <img class="equation_image" title="(x,y)" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/(x%252Cy)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: (x,y)" data-equation-content="(x,y)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> such that <img class="equation_image" title="\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\leq 1" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Csqrt%257Bx%255E2%252By%255E2%257D%255Cleq%25201?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\leq 1" data-equation-content="\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\leq 1" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. This is not too complicated, but if we wanted to integrate the function <img class="equation_image" title="f(x,y)=xy" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/f(x%252Cy)%253Dxy?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(x,y)=xy" data-equation-content="f(x,y)=xy" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> over the region, we would need to contend with the radical in the integration bounds via the integral <img class="equation_image" title="\iint f\cdot dA=\int_{-1}^1\int_{-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}} x\cdot y\cdot  dy dx" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Ciint%2520f%255Ccdot%2520dA%253D%255Cint_%257B-1%257D%255E1%255Cint_%257B-%255Csqrt%257B1-x%255E2%257D%257D%255E%257B%255Csqrt%257B1-x%255E2%257D%257D%2520x%255Ccdot%2520y%255Ccdot%2520%2520dy%2520dx?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \iint f\cdot dA=\int_{-1}^1\int_{-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}} x\cdot y\cdot  dy dx" data-equation-content="\iint f\cdot dA=\int_{-1}^1\int_{-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}} x\cdot y\cdot  dy dx" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.</p>

        <p>A major benefit of working in two and three dimensions is that we can create nice visual representations of various phenomena that faithfully reflect the underlying structure of mathematical operations. Single-variable integrals can be visualized as areas bounded on the x-y plane. Two-variable integrals can be visualized as volumes bounded between surfaces in three-dimensional space. Many models that we develop, however, involve many variables changing and shifting at once. The heat changes to a cooling metal sphere, for instance, depend on the three spatial variables that define the sphere and then the fourth variable of time. Modern optimization problems, as another example, deal with thousands of variables all shifting together. We can no longer easily visualize various fundamental processes, such as the cooling of objects over time. Luckily, the underlying mathematical actions stay the same! Integration still boils down to adding up small pieces of some measurement across an object or process.</p>
        <p>In this module, we will examine triple integrals, which deal with functions that vary according to three domain variables. In the same way that we created a two-dimensional grid to give us the small area regions <img class="equation_image" title="dA" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dA?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dA" data-equation-content="dA" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> over which we could sum to integrate, we now break apart volumes into small pieces <img class="equation_image" title="dV" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dV?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dV" data-equation-content="dV" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, make some measurements on each small volume, and add up each measurement along the entirety of a 3-dimensional domain object to make a triple integral.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As an example of this, suppose we wanted to measure the mass of some block with a variable density. Visualized in the following GeoGebra application is the boundary of such a block, and within that block, you can move around a small bit of volume, <img class="equation_image" title="dV" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dV?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dV" data-equation-content="dV" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, by altering the x, y, and z sliders or by dragging the point <img class="equation_image" title="(x,y,z)" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/(x%252Cy%252Cz)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: (x,y,z)" data-equation-content="(x,y,z)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. The small volume will change color based on its location, reflecting the changing density. The lighter color represents a region of low density, and the darker color represents a region of higher density.</p>
        <p><iframe style="border: 0px;" title="243 Mod 7 Cube Mass" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/yn6dgycn/width/740/height/481/border/888888/sfsb/true/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ai/false/asb/false/sri/false/rc/false/ld/false/sdz/true/ctl/false" width="740px" height="481px" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The mass of each small volume is calculated by <img class="equation_image" title="dM=\rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dM%253D%255Crho(x%252Cy%252Cz)%255Ccdot%2520dV?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dM=\rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV" data-equation-content="dM=\rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, and so we can calculate the total mass of the object by adding up all of the small masses across the entire object. This gives the total mass from the triple integral <img class="equation_image" title="M=\iiint dM=\iiint \rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/M%253D%255Ciiint%2520dM%253D%255Ciiint%2520%255Crho(x%252Cy%252Cz)%255Ccdot%2520dV?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: M=\iiint dM=\iiint \rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV" data-equation-content="M=\iiint dM=\iiint \rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.</p>
        <p>Since a cube volume is easily computed as the length-width-height product, we can rewrite the volume as <img class="equation_image" title="dV=dx\ dy\ dz" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dV%253Ddx%255C%2520dy%255C%2520dz?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dV=dx\ dy\ dz" data-equation-content="dV=dx\ dy\ dz" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, for an easy calculation <img class="equation_image" title="\iiint \rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV=\iiint \rho(x,y,z)\cdot dx\ dy\ dz" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Ciiint%2520%255Crho(x%252Cy%252Cz)%255Ccdot%2520dV%253D%255Ciiint%2520%255Crho(x%252Cy%252Cz)%255Ccdot%2520dx%255C%2520dy%255C%2520dz?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \iiint \rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV=\iiint \rho(x,y,z)\cdot dx\ dy\ dz" data-equation-content="\iiint \rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV=\iiint \rho(x,y,z)\cdot dx\ dy\ dz" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, which uses Fubini's Theorem again to handle one variable at a time.</p>
        <p>We will also want to use various coordinate systems to efficiently describe the volume pieces over which the integral is being constructed, which will require extending the idea of polar coordinates into two new 3-dimensional coordinate systems, cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates. With the increasing need to change coordinates to simplify definite integrals, we also need to extend our single-variable tool of u-substitution into the more complex multivariate setting.</p>

                <p>Just as double integrals allow us to deal with more general situations than could be handled by single integrals, triple integrals enable us to solve still more general problems.&nbsp; A very important thing to remember with triple integrals is that we can not easily visualize the output of the function being integrated. Most of the time, we can only visualize the domain of integration.</p>
                <p>One basic computation available to us that allows visualization is a volume calculation itself, which will also help us identify how we organize the sum from an integral. An easy way to approximate the volume of an object is to slice the object into small cubes, determine a unit for the cubes, and count how many cubes are contained in the volume. For objects like spheres, such approximations will never be exact for any cube size, but we can see that the volume does approach the true sphere volume when the cube size is small.</p>
                <p>This should unsurprisingly lead to the calculation of the true volume by taking a limit of the approximations from cubes, from which we get the volume integral <img class="equation_image" title="V=\iiint dV=\iiint dx\ dy\ dz" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/V%253D%255Ciiint%2520dV%253D%255Ciiint%2520dx%255C%2520dy%255C%2520dz?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: V=\iiint dV=\iiint dx\ dy\ dz" data-equation-content="V=\iiint dV=\iiint dx\ dy\ dz" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. Said plainly, we calculate volume by adding up the small volumes <img class="equation_image" title="dV=dx\ dy\ dz" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dV%253Ddx%255C%2520dy%255C%2520dz?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dV=dx\ dy\ dz" data-equation-content="dV=dx\ dy\ dz" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> along the interior of the sphere. This is true for any volume calculation.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>If we wanted to use a triple integral in some application other than volume, we would need to include some other function in the differential product, which takes the form <img class="equation_image" title="F=\iiint f\cdot dV=\iiint f(x,y,z)\cdot dx\ dy\ dz" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/F%253D%255Ciiint%2520f%255Ccdot%2520dV%253D%255Ciiint%2520f(x%252Cy%252Cz)%255Ccdot%2520dx%255C%2520dy%255C%2520dz?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: F=\iiint f\cdot dV=\iiint f(x,y,z)\cdot dx\ dy\ dz" data-equation-content="F=\iiint f\cdot dV=\iiint f(x,y,z)\cdot dx\ dy\ dz" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. As mentioned earlier, we unfortunately lose traditional means of visualizing the output of <img class="equation_image" title="f(x,y,z)" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/f(x%252Cy%252Cz)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(x,y,z)" data-equation-content="f(x,y,z)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> and instead can usually only view the volume over which <img class="equation_image" title="f" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/f?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f" data-equation-content="f" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is integrated. Mass, however, provides us with an application that accompanies a nice visual.</p>
                <p>If we know how dense an object is across a part of its volume, we can calculate mass as the product of the density and the volume, <img class="equation_image" title="dM=\rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dM%253D%255Crho(x%252Cy%252Cz)%255Ccdot%2520dV?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dM=\rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV" data-equation-content="dM=\rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. We can visualize the density of a region using color, as is seen in the following GeoGebra application. You control this in the same way you control the GeoGebra application in the Overview, and again, we have that the color of the small volume element represents its density. Brighter colors represent less dense regions of the object, and darker colors represent more dense regions of the object.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This use of color at least allows us to observe variation in the function <img class="equation_image" title="\rho(x,y,z)" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Crho(x%252Cy%252Cz)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \rho(x,y,z)" data-equation-content="\rho(x,y,z)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> along the object, which results in a mass integral <img class="equation_image" title="M=\iiint dM=\iiint \rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/M%253D%255Ciiint%2520dM%253D%255Ciiint%2520%255Crho(x%252Cy%252Cz)%255Ccdot%2520dV?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: M=\iiint dM=\iiint \rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV" data-equation-content="M=\iiint dM=\iiint \rho(x,y,z)\cdot dV" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> simulating the area generated in a single integral <img class="equation_image" title="A=\int f(x)\cdot dx" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/A%253D%255Cint%2520f(x)%255Ccdot%2520dx?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: A=\int f(x)\cdot dx" data-equation-content="A=\int f(x)\cdot dx" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> or the volume generated in a double integral <img class="equation_image" title="V=\int f(x,y)\cdot dx\ dy" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/V%253D%255Cint%2520f(x%252Cy)%255Ccdot%2520dx%255C%2520dy?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: V=\int f(x,y)\cdot dx\ dy" data-equation-content="V=\int f(x,y)\cdot dx\ dy" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. As you develop other applications of the triple integral, you can always return to the intuition of a mass integral when trying to make sense of the basic ways that a general triple integral <img class="equation_image" title="F=\iiint f\cdot dV=\iiint f(x,y,z)\cdot dx\ dy\ dz" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/F%253D%255Ciiint%2520f%255Ccdot%2520dV%253D%255Ciiint%2520f(x%252Cy%252Cz)%255Ccdot%2520dx%255C%2520dy%255C%2520dz?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: F=\iiint f\cdot dV=\iiint f(x,y,z)\cdot dx\ dy\ dz" data-equation-content="F=\iiint f\cdot dV=\iiint f(x,y,z)\cdot dx\ dy\ dz" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is calculated.</p>

                <p>When a calculation in physics, engineering, or geometry involves a cylinder, cone, or sphere, we can often simplify our work by using cylindrical or spherical coordinates, which are extensions of polar coordinates into three dimensions. The basic volume element in rectangular coordinates is <img class="equation_image" title="dV=dx\ dy\ dz" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dV%253Ddx%255C%2520dy%255C%2520dz?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dV=dx\ dy\ dz" data-equation-content="dV=dx\ dy\ dz" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, which is taken from the volume of a cube. To better describe various curved volumes, we extend polar coordinates in two ways.</p>
                <p>The first way is to take a polar area with radius change <img class="equation_image" title="dr" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dr?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dr" data-equation-content="dr" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> and angle measure change <img class="equation_image" title="d\theta" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/d%255Ctheta?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: d\theta" data-equation-content="d\theta" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> and to make it a cylinder by multiplying the resulting area by height <img class="equation_image" title="dz" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dz?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dz" data-equation-content="dz" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. Since the polar area of a curved region is given by <img class="equation_image" title="dA=r \cdot dr\ d\theta" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dA%253Dr%2520%255Ccdot%2520dr%255C%2520d%255Ctheta?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dA=r \cdot dr\ d\theta" data-equation-content="dA=r \cdot dr\ d\theta" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, the resulting cylindrical volume is given by <img class="equation_image" title="dV=dA\ dz=r\cdot dr\ d\theta\ dz" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dV%253DdA%255C%2520dz%253Dr%255Ccdot%2520dr%255C%2520d%255Ctheta%255C%2520dz?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dV=dA\ dz=r\cdot dr\ d\theta\ dz" data-equation-content="dV=dA\ dz=r\cdot dr\ d\theta\ dz" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. The other way to extend the notion of polar coordinates into a three-dimensional system is to observe that any point in space can be described as having some distance <img class="equation_image" title="\rho" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Crho?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \rho" data-equation-content="\rho" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> from the origin, some horizontal rotation <img class="equation_image" title="\theta" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Ctheta?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \theta" data-equation-content="\theta" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> from the positive x-axis, and some rotation <img class="equation_image" title="\phi" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Cphi?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \phi" data-equation-content="\phi" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> upward or downward. This new coordinate system describes points in space.</p>
                <p>You will read about the details of switching between rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates in the eText, but for now, you can visualize these three coordinate systems in the following GeoGebra application. You may choose to view the cylinder or the sphere at one time. You may zoom to the volume element or back to the global shape, and you may alter the three variables determining the volume's position.</p>
                <p><iframe style="border: 0px;" title="243 Mod 7 Cylinder and Sphere" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/xqrs44yg/width/750/height/675/border/888888/sfsb/true/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ai/false/asb/false/sri/false/rc/false/ld/false/sdz/true/ctl/false" width="750px" height="675px" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
                <p>The spherical volume differential is given by <img class="equation_image" title="dV=\rho^2\sin(\phi)\cdot d\rho\ d\phi\ d\theta" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dV%253D%255Crho%255E2%255Csin(%255Cphi)%255Ccdot%2520d%255Crho%255C%2520d%255Cphi%255C%2520d%255Ctheta?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dV=\rho^2\sin(\phi)\cdot d\rho\ d\phi\ d\theta" data-equation-content="dV=\rho^2\sin(\phi)\cdot d\rho\ d\phi\ d\theta" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. While these three coordinate systems form a good foundation for the various ways to represent physical space when computing triple integrals, there are other coordinate systems that we may want to devise on a case-by-case basis. The way to determine the volume elements <img class="equation_image" title="dV" src="https://erau.instructure.com/equation_images/dV?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: dV" data-equation-content="dV" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> for these new coordinate systems involves mapping from a known coordinate system and generalizing the single-variable u-substitution process by attending to the derivatives of the map using what is called the Jacobian.</p>
